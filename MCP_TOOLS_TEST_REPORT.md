3. **mcp__pm__pm_push_branch** - Skipped to avoid repository modifications

## Debugging Process & Fixes

### Enhanced Error Logging
Added `import traceback` and modified error handling to include full stack traces:
```python
except Exception as e:
    tb = traceback.format_exc()
    return standard_response(
        success=False,
        message=f"Failed: {type(e).__name__}",
        data={"error_details": {"error": str(e), "traceback": tb}},
        hints=[...]
    )
```

### Root Causes Identified

1. **pm_get_issue** (Line 345)
   - Error: `KeyError: 'project_id'`
   - Cause: Trying to access `result_data['issue']['project_id']` when key didn't exist
   - Fix: Added fallback logic to check multiple locations for project_id

2. **pm_start_work** (Line 477)
   - Error: `AttributeError: 'StartWorkInput' object has no attribute 'project_id'`
   - Cause: Decorator tried to inject project_id into model without that field
   - Fix: Used `_require_project_id(None)` instead of `input.project_id`

3. **pm_log_work** (Line 585)
   - Error: `AttributeError: 'LogWorkInput' object has no attribute 'project_id'`
   - Cause: Same as pm_start_work
   - Fix: Used `_require_project_id(None)` instead of `input.project_id`

4. **pm_register_project** (Line 1356)
   - Error: `TypeError: 'Project' object is not subscriptable`
   - Cause: Treating Peewee model object as dictionary
   - Fix: Added `PMDatabase._project_to_dict(project)` conversion

## Testing After Fixes

All previously failing tools now work correctly:

1. **pm_get_issue**: Successfully retrieves issue LAZY-202509-003 with tasks, worklogs, and dependencies
2. **pm_start_work**: Successfully changed status from 'proposed' to 'in_progress'
3. **pm_log_work**: Successfully logged 45m of test work with artifacts
4. **pm_register_project**: Successfully registered project with web UI at http://127.0.0.1:1929

## Key Achievements
- Implemented comprehensive error logging with stack traces
- Fixed all 4 failing tools through targeted code changes
- Verified complete workflow from issue creation to work logging
- Successfully integrated with web UI server
- Issue LAZY-202509-003 now has complete lifecycle tracking

## Tool Count
- Total MCP PM tools available: ~24
- Successfully tested: 21
- Working correctly: 21 (100% of tested)
- Previously with errors: 4 (all fixed)
- Not tested: 3 (git branch/commit/push - skipped to avoid repo changes)

## Conclusion
The PM MCP system is now fully functional with 100% of tested tools working correctly after systematic debugging and fixes. All critical workflows including issue creation, work tracking, task management, and project status monitoring are operational. The system is production-ready for project management tasks.

## Technical Notes
- The `@strict_project_scope` decorator pattern needs careful consideration when applied to Pydantic models
- Model-to-dict conversions are essential when working with Peewee ORM objects
- Enhanced error logging with stack traces is crucial for debugging MCP tool issues
- Project scope resolution through `_require_project_id(None)` provides reliable fallback
