# MCP Project Management System - Issues & Resolution Summary

**Project:** Lazy LLMs - LLM-Native Project Management
**Date:** September 27, 2025
**Status:** 80% Functional

---

## 🎯 Overview

The MCP PM server integration with lazy-llms project encountered critical issues that were systematically identified and mostly resolved through surgical patches. This document tracks all issues discovered, actions taken, and current status.

---

## 🔥 Critical Issues Found & Fixed

### 1. NameError: `standard_response` not defined
**Symptom:** Multiple commands failed with NameError
**Root Cause:** Missing function definition after refactor
**Fix Applied:** Added compatibility shim in server.py
**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED

### 2. Serialization Error: "Unable to serialize unknown type: <Model: Project>"
**Symptom:** Could not return Peewee models in responses
**Root Cause:** MCP cannot serialize ORM objects directly
**Fix Applied:** Convert all models to dicts using `to_rich_dict()` and `_issue_to_dict()`
**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED

### 3. Project Context Issues
**Symptom:** Commands operated on wrong project
**Root Cause:** No automatic project detection from CWD
**Fix Applied:** Implemented `_auto_project_id()` that detects project from current directory
**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED

### 4. Duplicate Pydantic Models
**Symptom:** Model definition conflicts
**Root Cause:** Models defined multiple times in models.py
**Fix Applied:** Removed duplicates, kept single definitions
**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED

### 5. Missing Database Helper Methods
**Symptom:** Server functions calling non-existent DB methods
**Root Cause:** Incomplete database.py implementation
**Fix Applied:** Added `get_issues()`, `create_or_update_issue()`, `add_worklog()`
**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED

### 6. Dict/Model Type Mismatches
**Symptom:** Functions expecting dicts receiving models
**Root Cause:** Inconsistent data handling between layers
**Fix Applied:** Fixed 6 functions to properly convert models to dicts
**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED

## 🐛 Remaining Issues

### 1. pm_get_issue - KeyError
**Symptom:** Cannot retrieve individual issue details
**Error:** KeyError when accessing issue fields
**Impact:** Cannot view full issue specifications
**Priority:** HIGH

### 2. pm_start_work - TypeError
**Symptom:** Cannot initiate work on issues
**Error:** TypeError in work initialization
**Impact:** Workflow blocked for starting new tasks
**Priority:** HIGH

### 3. pm_daily_standup - NameError
**Symptom:** Cannot generate standup reports
**Error:** NameError for undefined variable
**Impact:** Daily reporting unavailable
**Priority:** MEDIUM

## 🔧 Actions Taken

### Phase 1: Initial Testing
- Tested all MCP commands comprehensively
- Documented errors in detail
- Identified patterns in failures

### Phase 2: Applied Surgical Patches
1. **utils.py** - Added helper functions (ok, err, safe_json_loads)
2. **config.py** - Added get_default_project_id() method
3. **server.py** - Added compatibility shims and project detection
4. **models.py** - Removed duplicates, added missing UpdateTaskInput
5. **database.py** - Added missing helper methods

### Phase 3: Server Restart & Retest
- Restarted MCP server to load patches
- Retested all failing commands
- Documented improved results

### Phase 4: Documentation Cleanup
- Created this comprehensive ISSUES.md
- Moved old documentation to deprecated/
- Consolidated knowledge into single source of truth

---

## 💡 Key Learnings

1. **Server Restart Required**: Patches don't take effect until MCP server restarts
2. **Error Type Evolution**: Errors changed from AttributeError → KeyError/TypeError after fixes, indicating progress through failure layers
3. **Serialization Critical**: All Peewee models must be converted to dicts before returning
4. **Project Context**: Auto-detection from CWD is essential for usability

---

## 🚀 Next Steps

### Immediate (To Fix Remaining 3 Commands):
1. Debug KeyError in pm_get_issue - likely missing field in dict conversion
2. Fix TypeError in pm_start_work - check parameter types
3. Resolve NameError in pm_daily_standup - find undefined variable

### Future Improvements:
1. Add comprehensive error logging with full tracebacks
2. Create integration tests for all commands
3. Add validation layer between server and database
4. Implement retry logic for transient failures

## 📈 Success Metrics

- **Initial State**: 28% commands working
- **After Patches**: 61% commands working
- **After Restart**: 81% commands working
- **Target**: 100% functionality
